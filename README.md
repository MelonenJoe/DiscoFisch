# DiscoFisch

This is a Plugin I randomly coded because I was bored.
The Plugin adds a /discofisch command which gives you a Bucket that can spawn a Discofish (a fish that changes his color every 10 ticks). You can use the Bucket infinitely to spawn Discofishes.
I think the Fishes ended up really nice and I hope you like it too.

**Other Information:**
This Plugin is in the Language German!
